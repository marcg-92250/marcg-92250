## About Me
I am a dedicated and ambitious 4th-year student at EPITA, an engineering school in Paris, specializing in new technologies and Artificial Intelligence. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering, while my practical experiences have allowed me to apply these skills in real-world projects.

I currently work as a Developer at Cristal, EPITA‚Äôs junior enterprise, where I contribute to innovative solutions and collaborate with a talented team. In addition, I develop for Rayan Drissi's agency, engaging in projects that push my creative and technical boundaries. As an external contractor for ByomeLabs, a startup in the dermocosmetics industry, I help design and implement technology solutions that bridge the gap between beauty and science.

My goal is to continuously enhance my technical skills and broaden my professional network, while tackling new challenges and contributing to impactful projects in the tech industry.
